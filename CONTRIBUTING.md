# Development and Contributing Guide

This document provides instructions for developers who want
to build/test/release spin.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+

## Release Procedure

The version scheme used is major.minor.patch while following the well-known
standards @CONTACT (https://wiki.contact.de/index.php/Versionsnummer).
Steps to create a release:

0. Preparations

   - Verify that all relevant changes are merged into the master branch, which
     is the source for all releases.
   - Also make sure that the latest non-scheduled master pipeline is green.
   - Ensure that release related merge request and issues are labeled and closed
     properly.
   - If there is a milestone, make sure that all tasks are done.

1. Enter the repository within GitLab > Releases > New Release, select the
   master branch and desired tag. Further down, enter the release notes
   including a list of changes (e.g. mention resolved issue + link related MR)
   and further information that might be useful. Make sure to align the style of
   the release notes to those of previous releases.

2. Hit "Create release" âœ¨

3. [optional] If the change need to be distributed within the
   [cetest](https://code.contact.de/qs/images/cetest) image, follow the release
   procedure there.

4. [optional] Create a DemoIT! demonstrating the latest improvements of spin.
