# Vision of Doc-Building and Documentation Layout

> https://docs.contact.de/15.8-en/design/ce_ua_authoring/inform_about?highlight=diataxis.fr

**cs.spin**:

- documentation for cs.spin must be updated to match the current state (also remove examples that reference to builtin plugins)
- extend the documentation in terms of references to the QA-maintained plugin-packages below qs/spin (including a short description about which use-cases are covered by which plugin-package)

**plugin-packages**:

each plugin-package documentation will/should have the following structure:

1. Introduction - What is this plugin-package about (short "reference"-style ala diataxis)<br>
2. Installation / Setup / Usage - How to install the plugin-package ("howto"-style ala diataxis)<br>
3. \<plugin-name\> - Individual section for each included plugin (where not all
   parts below are mandatory, depending on the complexity of the plugin) <br>
   3.1 What is this plugin about ("reference"-style ala diataxis) <br>
   3.2-3.n How to to setup the plugin ... for use-case X ("howto"-style ala diataxis)<br>
   3.n+1 schema reference (generated by `spin schemadoc <plugin-name>`)
   ("reference"-style ala diataxis)<br>
