============
Installation
============

Spin requires Python 3.9 or later, and you can install it using any
way you like using :program:`pip`. It is most convenient to have the ``spin``
command locally installed and always available on your ``PATH``, just like a
system command.

One easy way of installing `spin` privately in your home directory is by using
:program:`pipx`, as described in the next section.


Installing with pipx
====================

`pipx`_ is a tool that installs Python packages into a user-specific location
in a user's ``HOME`` directory. You can install it like so:

.. code-block:: console
   :caption: Installation of pipx

   python -m pip install --user pipx
   python -m pipx ensurepath

``ensurepath`` adds ``$HOME/.local/bin`` to your shell's configuration, so
commands from packages installed by ``pipx`` are available in ``PATH``. Make
sure to restart your shell to make the setting effective.

Installing spin is as easy as follows:

.. code-block:: console
   :caption: Installation of csspin using pipx

   pipx install csspin
