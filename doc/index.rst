Welcome to spin's documentation!
================================

Spin is a task runner with a twist: it focuses on standardizing
workflows for heterogeneous technology stacks and re-usable task
definitions in the form of Python packages for engineering teams with
a large number of projects.

Spin doesn't try to replace established tools for building, testing,
measuring and releasing software. Spin encapsulates knowledge of best
practices in using those tools and orchestrates tools into a
meaningful workflow.
